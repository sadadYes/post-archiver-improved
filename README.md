# Post Archiver Improved
This project aims to replace and improve [post-archiver](https://github.com/sadadYes/post-archiver). This project is still in early development so there might be some issues present, I am actually still learning about some stuff too woth this project.

This project is *heavily* inspired by a certain [yt-dlp plugin](https://github.com/biggestsonicfan/yt-dlp-community-plugin) by [biggestsonicfan](https://github.com/biggestsonicfan).

## Goals
* Bulk archiver for youtube community posts
* Zero dependencies
* Lightweight and fast
